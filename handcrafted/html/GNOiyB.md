**Feedback vertex set**, also called *cycle transversal*, is very simiar to [[4lp9Yj]] but focuses on cycles instead of edges.
With bounded feedback vertex set, we can partition the graph into a *modulator* of $k$ vertices and a forest.
It generalizes [[HTk9PZ]] for the price of having an arbitrary connection from its modulator to the forest.
