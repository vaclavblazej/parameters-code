## Graph classes

Some parameters are derived from associated graph classes.
Graph classes can be also used as witnesses of proper inclusions.
For these purposes, we use the following graph class hierarchy.

We aim to have here only the graph classes that influence parameter inclusions.
Please, see [Information System on Graph Classes and their Inclusions (ISGCI)](https://www.graphclasses.org/) for an exhaustive list of graph classes and their inclusions.
