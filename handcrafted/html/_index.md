## Graph classes and Properties

Some parameters are derived from associated graph classes.
Graph classes can be also used as witnesses of proper inclusions.
For these purposes, we use the following graph class hierarchy.
We assume that all of the graph class inclusions are proper.

We aim to have here only the graph classes that influence parameter inclusions.
Please, see [Information System on Graph Classes and their Inclusions (ISGCI)](https://www.graphclasses.org/) for an exhaustive list of graph classes and their inclusions.
