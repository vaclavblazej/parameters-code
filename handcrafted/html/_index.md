## Parameters

The hierarchy of parameters is still under construction -- contributions to its refinement are greatly appreciated.
The following diagram shows parameter inclusions.
Arrow styles: normal for linear, thin for polynomial, dotted for exponential, gray for "under construction".
Arrows that can be implied by other arrows are hidden for clarity.

[[pdf parameters.pdf]]

We follow with a complete comparison of all pairs of parameters.
Row-to-column meaning is: green for inclusion (bounded), red for exclusion (unbounded), blue for "under construction"
The above diagram shows only a meaningful subset of the green relations below.

## Graph classes

Some parameters are derived from associated graph classes.
Graph classes can be also used as witnesses of proper inclusions.
For these purposes, we use the following graph class hierarchy.
We assume that all of the graph class inclusions are proper.

We aim to have here only the graph classes that influence parameter inclusions.
Please, see [Information System on Graph Classes and their Inclusions (ISGCI)](https://www.graphclasses.org/) for an exhaustive list of graph classes and their inclusions.
