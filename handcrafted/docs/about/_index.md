## About

This project was created in hopes to make parameters and their relations easy to find.

## Influences

The creation of this website was inspired by a few previous projects that gathered hierarchy between some parameters.
Main influences come from the following ones:

* [The Graph Parameter Hierarchy](https://manyu.pro/assets/parameter-hierarchy.pdf) by Manuel Sorge -- Paper-like PDF that depicts relation between parameters, and either shows or links to proofs for some of their relations. It is open source so anyone can help with it.
* [Information system on Graph classes and their Inclusions (ISGCI)](https://www.graphclasses.org/) -- A huge project that gathers information about graphs. M. Sorge added information about parameters (about 30 of them), their relations, and references into ISGCI version 4. However, the project does not seem to be up to date with the latest developments in parameterized complexity.
* [Comparing Graph Parameters, Bachelor's Thesis of J. Schr√∂der](https://fpt.akt.tu-berlin.de/publications/theses/BA-Schr%C3%B6der.pdf) -- Lists many parameters and their relations, but also shows their incomparabilities. The comparison table in HOPS is directly inspired by the table shown in the thesis.

## HOPS history

Aside from the influences listed above, the project idea floated around during years prior to 2022 in the collective of [GGOAT members](https://ggoat.fit.cvut.cz/members.html) of Department of Computer Science, [FIT CTU](https://fit.cvut.cz/) in Prague; whose members were in turn influenced by collaborations and prior experience from other places including TU Wien, TU Berlin, and University of Bergen.

First code of the project was written by the end of 2022 and was later published as a static page on GitHub pages, where it still resides.
The code was written in python3 which generated markdown pages with graphic PDFs that were then converted to html web pages using Hugo.

During the second half of 2023 the project's backend was rewritten into Rust.
In April of 2024 the revised backend matched the old code and the page was updated, with more frequent updates after (about every 3 months).

Although missing many planned features, near the end of 2024 the project was presented during a few workshops and seminars, extending a subset of the community aware of it.
